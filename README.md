In short: You contribute 7% of your monthly post-tax income to a pool, and the average is distributed to all participants.
Example: If you make $70,000 per year, you contribute ~$260. If the pooled average is $50,000 per year, then you would receive ~$186 back. If you're unemployed, you would receive ~$186 from a community member.
